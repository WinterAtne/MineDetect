MineDetect is a simple clone of minesweeper written entirely in raw C. It runs in the terminal, and should work on Linux, Mac, and Windows(altho the later two are untested). It comes bundled with an AI that can solve the game the majority of the time.

# Building
It should be compiled using one of the two commands
```
make pc
```
or for the ai version
```
make ai
```

The program can then be run using ./Minesweep.out on linux.
